The objective is to build a library similar to pandas, a DataFrame class with data stored in Numpy arrays. Using this library, we can read the data from CSV file, select subsets of data with brackets operator, use special methods defined in the python data model, implement aggregation function like sum, min, max, median and non-aggregation function includes isna, unique, rename, drop on the data. Grouping of one or more columns based on pivot condition and string manipulation on columns can be done using this library.
Our 6 - step approach for developing this library:
i.	Creating a DataFrame class constructor with specific input types.
ii.	Defining basic properties and visual representation of the DataFrame class.
iii.	Developing the subset selection property of the DataFrame Class.
iv.	Defining generic aggregation and non-aggregation methods using Numpy Arrays.
v.	Developing the pivot table functionality of the DataFrame class.
vi.	Developing code for dynamic documentation of class methods, string manipulation and reading the data from CSV files.
